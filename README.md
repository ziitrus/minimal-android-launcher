ðŸ“± Minimal Screen â€“ A Minimalist Android Launcher

Less screen time. More real life.

Minimal Screen is a distraction-free Android launcher designed to help you reclaim your time and focus.
âœ¨ Features

    ðŸŽ¯ Only 3 custom shortcuts on the home screen

    ðŸ“¦ An "All Apps" button â€” but with a twist:
    â†’ Youâ€™ll need to wait 10 seconds before it opens
    â†’ Just enough time to ask: "Do I really need this?"

ðŸ”’ No clutter. No feed. No dopamine traps.

Minimal Screen is intentionally limited â€” to keep you in control, not your phone.
